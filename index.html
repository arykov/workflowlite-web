  <h1>About Workflow Lite</h1>
  <p align="justify">We set out to fill the gap left in the Business Process Management space when major vendors abandoned light weight products in favour of behemoth suites. When products like WebLogic Integration were discontinued with no cost effective upgrade path, we decided to offer an alternative: <b>Workflow Lite.</b></p>

  <h1>Simple</h1>
  <p align="justify">Workflow Lite fosters simplicity. If you are familiar with Java and Spring, it is trivial to grasp. There are no suites to configure, no new tools to learn. Just add our jar into your application and you are good to go.</p>

  <h1>Reliable</h1>
  <p align="justify">Simple design based on a time proven mathematical foundation with a handful of proven technologies makes Workflow Lite very reliable.</p>

  <h1>Efficient</h1>
  <p align="justify">We made sure that our solution is highly performant. You will not have to worry about new product tuning complexity during the most trying phases of your projects.</p>

  <h1>Portable</h1>
  <p  align="justify">Conversion from Oracle/BEA WLI is simple and well documented. JPD process definitions format is natively supported. </p>

  <h1>Testable</h1>
  <p  align="justify">Business process flows can quickly become fairly complex. Their testing does not have to be. Yet to this day it is far from trivial with all major products. Workflow Lite flows are different and can be tested the same way your java code is with no need for lengthy deployments and test specific customizations.</p>
